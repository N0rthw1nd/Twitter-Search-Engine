Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat.
Pork is one of the most popular forms of meat in the world.
Despite some confusion on the issue, pork is classed as red meat. This is because it contains a large amount of myoglobin, a protein responsible for the red color of meat.
When most people think of red meat, they probably imagine beef.
There are many different beef products and cuts of beef, ranging from hamburgers to ribeye steaks.
Both lamb and mutton are very similar types of meat, with one fundamental difference;
Lamb is from a sheep less than one-year-old
Mutton is the meat of an adult sheep
Just like beef and pork, there are a variety of popular lamb cuts — perhaps lamb chops are the most popular.
Alongside beef and pork, chicken is one of the ‘big three’ popularity-wise.
However, chicken is a different classification of meat and comes under the poultry category.
People commonly refer to poultry as ‘white meat’.
As one of the most popular foods in the world, there are all sorts of chicken-based foods. These range from fried and roasted chicken to chicken soup and even chicken popcorn.
For those who are trying to consume less fat/calories, chicken offers a smaller amount than other meats but with the same protein content. In other words, chicken is protein-dense.
Turkey is another type of white meat, probably best known for its appearance at the Christmas table.
It has both a deeper yet drier taste than chicken and is a less prevalent form of poultry.
As mentioned above, the most popular kind is probably roast turkey, but you can find a variety of processed and unprocessed turkey products.
